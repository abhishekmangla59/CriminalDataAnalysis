This site allows you to visualize and analyze Chicago's crime statistics.  Some specifics include:
+ Basic statistics over time
+ Seeing individual crimes on a map of Chicago
+ Using a heat map to see trends in crime
+ Some time series analyses that show trends and abrupt changes in crime
+ The relationship between weather and crime
+ The underlying crime data 

To use the site, simply enter a crime type of your choice (e.g. Theft). If may take up to 30 seconds for some of the pages to load when performing a large analysis.  

Additional options include changing the date range (the site contains data from 2001 to 2014) and the community area.  There is also an option to change the period of analysis, which is useful for functions that aggregate crimes over time.

When using the maps, you can recenter by map by choosing a different location, either by city name or zip code.  You can also zoom as well as change the type of map.

This site is designed for people to learn and explore relationships in crime data. Portions of the site may have errors/slowdowns if you either try to query too much data or have a query that is too narrow.
